# 3. My first Java Class	

	 
##  Write helloworld Java program and start working. 

      class HelloWorld{
      public static void main(String args[]){
           System.out.println("Hello World"); 
         } 
      } 
  
 ## Note :
 ### The bin contains the tools to compile and execute your Java program.

# 4. JDK JRE JVM and Java API

### JDK

Java Developer Kit contains tools needed to develop the Java programs, and JRE to run the programs. The tools include compiler (javac.exe), Java application launcher (java.exe), Appletviewer, etc… Compiler converts java code into byte code. Java application launcher opens a JRE, loads the class, and invokes its main method. The JDK is a development environment for building applications using the Java programming language.


### JRE

JRE = JVM + Class Libraries+ supporting files 

Java Runtime Environment contains JVM, class libraries, and other supporting files. It does not contain any development tools such as compiler, debugger, etc. Actually, JVM runs the program, and it uses the class libraries, and other supporting files provided in JRE. If you want to run any java program, you need to have JRE installed in the system.


### JVM

The JVM translates bytecode into native machine code.
The Java Virtual Machine provides a platform-independent way of executing code; programmers can concentrate on writing software, without having to be concerned with how or where it will run. 

### JAVA API 

API stands for Application Programming Interface. API contains all the classes and interfaces developed by Java people . If we develop any code this must be combined with API code to execute the programs.
<br />

### With most programming languages, you either compile or interpret a program so that you can run it on your computer. 

### The Java programming language is unusual in that a program is both compiled and interpreted. 
### With the compiler,first you translate a program into an intermediate language called Java bytecodes — the Platform-Independent codes interpreted by the interpreter on the Java platform. 
### The interpreter parses and runs each Java bytecode instruction on the computer. Compilation happens just once; interpretation occurs each time the program is executed.


# 5. Why Java is Popular

### Java is Popular because of its Design Goals .

The authors of JAVA have written an influential White Paper that explains their <b> design goals </b> and accomplishments.  

THE JAVA “WHITE PAPER” BUZZWORDS written by James Gosling and Henry McGilton.

### 1.	SIMPLE   
### 2.	OBJECT ORIETED
### 3.	DISTRIBUTED
### 4.	MULTIHREADED
### 5.	DYNAMIC
### 6.	ARCHITECTURAL NEUTRAL
### 7.	PORTABLE
### 8.	HIGH PERFORMANCE
### 9.	ROBUST
##  10. SECURE
<br />

##  SIMPLE
Java syntax is, indeed a cleaned-up version of the syntax for c++. Java omits many rarely used, poorly understood, confusing features of C++ that in our experience, bring more grief than benefit. There is no need for header files, pointer arithmetic, structures, unions, operator overloading, virtual base classes, and so on.EASY TO LEARN FOR PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMMERS AND AND EASY TO USE

## OBJECT ORIETED
The object-oriented design is a technique for programming that focuses on the data (=> objects) and on interfaces to that object. To make analogy with carpentry, an “objected –oriented” carpenter would be mostly concerned with the chair he has building and secondarily with the tools used to make it. A “non-object-oriented” carpenter would think primarily of his tools. The objected-oriented facilities of Java are essentially those of c++.
WE CAN FULLY UTILIZE THE OBJECT-ORIENTED PROPERTIES OR NOT.

##  DISTRIBUTED 
Java was designed for the distributed environment of the internet because it handles TCP/IP protocols. 
The client-server model is allowed the programs to talk each other form different systems.
Through RMI Package. 
WE CAN DISTRIBUTE JAVA APPLICATIONS ACROSS MULTIPLE JVMs. 

## MULTIHREADED
Java was designed to meet the real-world requirement of creating interactive and network-based programs. To accomplish this, Java supports multithreaded programming, which allows you to write programs that do many things simultaneously. The java runtime system comes with multi process synchronization that enables you to construct smoothly running interactive systems. Java’s easy-to-use approach to multithreading allows you to think about the specific behavior of your program, not the multitasking subsystem. BY RUNNING MULTIPLE THEREADS AT A TIJME WE CAN IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE.

## DYNAMIC
Java programs carry with them substantial amounts of runtime type information that is used to provide and resolve access to objects at runtime. This makes it possible to dynamically link code in a safe and expedient manner this is crucial to the robustness of the Java environment, in which small fragments of byte codes may be dynamically updated on runtime system. LOAD ON DEMAND.

##  ARCHITECTURE NEUTRAL
A central issue for the Java designers was that of code longevity and portability. One of the main problems facing programmers is that no guarantee exists that if you write a program today, it will run tomorrow—even on the same machine. Operating system upgrades, processor upgrades, and changes in core system resources can all combine to make a program malfunction. The Java designers made several hard decisions in the Java language and the Java Virtual Machine in an attempt to alter this situation. Their goal was “write once; run anywhere, anytime, forever” To a great extent, this goal was accomplished.

## PORTABLE

One of the main problems facing programmers is that no guarantee exists that if you write today, it will run tomorrow – even on the same machine.

To greater extent, this goal was accomplished.  MIGRATING ONE MACHINE TO ANDOTHER MACHINE WITHOUT ANY CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM.

# Difference between OpenJDK and OracleJDK


# A key difference going forward is the ReleaseSchedule and SupportPolicy.

## OpenJDK

 OpenJDK will have a feature release every 6 months which is only supported until the next feature release. It's essentially a continuous stream of releases   targeted to developers.

## Oracle JDK

The Oracle JDK is targeted more towards an enterprise audience which values stability. It's based on one of the OpenJDK releases but is then given long term support (LTS). The Oracle JDK has releases planned every 3 years.

Both OpenJDK and Oracle JDK are created and maintained currently by Oracle only.

OpenJDK and Oracle JDK are implementations of the same Java specification passed the TCK (Java Technology Certification Kit).

Most of the vendors of JDK are written on top of OpenJDK by doing a few tweaks to [mostly to replace licensed proprietary parts / replace with more high-performance items that only work on specific OS] components without breaking the TCK compatibility.


Many vendors implemented the Java specification and got TCK passed. For example, IBM J9, Azul Zulu, Azul Zing, and Oracle JDK.
Almost every existing JDK is derived from OpenJDK.

As suggested by many, licensing is a change between JDKs.

Starting with JDK 11 accessing the long-time support Oracle JDK/Java SE will now require a commercial license. 

You should now pay attention to which JDK you're installing as Oracle JDK without subscription could stop working.
